                    <h3>1. Education is flawed globally</h3>
                    <p>Universities and higher education institutions are universally failing to fulfil their mission - to teach their students well. The gap between the needs of employers and student knowledge already exists and is widening. BitDegree innovation is the possibility for business to initiate and maintain dialogue with upcoming talent and reward them for achievements through smart-incentives. From the studentâ€™s perspective it means - getting paid to learn.

                    <h3>2. Helps recruiting tech talent</h3>
                    <p>It is estimated that the global recruitment market is worth over $200 billion and $4,000 is the average amount spent by a U.S. company to fill an open position. Tech companies are actively competing to constantly raise and maintain their employer profiles, offering perks unimaginable in other industries. Our solution here is to provide global employer branding to millions of BitDegree students by sponsoring smart-incentives.</p>

                    <h3>3. Tech students are valued customers</h3>
                    <p>With a traditional client acquisition model, tech companies like Hostinger, DigitalOcean or NordVPN spend huge amounts to acquire new customers. By accepting decentralized BitDegree tokens, they will be able to attract new flow of technophile users in a cost-effective way. Students who earned scholarships are qualified customers with a proven interest in learning technology & are willing to spend on various products & services.</p>

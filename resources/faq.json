Some arbitrary graphics like a burning fuse or a hungry child can help provide context. Eventually, we consider creating a higher level context for the entire program that would provide a reason for doing this task whether it be killing the dragon or saving the real world. By creating a contextualized identity for learners, we make course assignments more personally relevant thereby enhancing both learning and motivation to continue and complete the work.</p>"
